# Simple LLM Project - LLM from scratch

This project is based on the course/video by Andrej Karpathy, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=4463s).

I followed the video to understand the concepts and wrote the code myself to gain hands-on experience in building a simple language model from scratch.
